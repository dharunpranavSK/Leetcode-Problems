QUESTION:-
You are given a 0-indexed array of string words and two integers left and right.
A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel character and ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
Return the number of vowel strings words[i] where i belongs to the inclusive range [left, right].

Example 1:
Input: words = ["are","amy","u"], left = 0, right = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- "are" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.
- "amy" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.
- "u" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["hey","aeo","mu","ooo","artro"], left = 1, right = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- "aeo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
- "mu" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.
- "ooo" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.
- "artro" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.
The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 3.

CODE:-
int vowelStrings(char** a, int wordsSize, int left, int right) {
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        int l = strlen(a[i]) - 1;
        if(((a[i][0]=='a')||(a[i][0]=='e')||(a[i][0]=='i')||(a[i][0]=='o')||(a[i][0]=='u')) &&
           ((a[i][l]=='a')||(a[i][l]=='e')||(a[i][l]=='i')||(a[i][l]=='o')||(a[i][l]=='u'))) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
